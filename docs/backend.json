    "reasoning": "Based on the requirements, the proposed Firestore structure focuses on simplicity, security, and scalability, leveraging path-based ownership for managing error reports. All reports are stored under a common path to allow secure list operations and simplified security rules.\n\n**Authorization Independence:**\n\n*   Since all users are anonymous, there is no need to denormalize authorization data into documents. Instead, ownership is implicitly managed by the path `/artifacts/{appId}/public/data/error_reports/{errorReportId}`.\n\n**Structural Segregation:**\n\n*   All error reports, regardless of the submitter, are stored in the same collection (`/artifacts/{appId}/public/data/error_reports`). This ensures a homogeneous security posture where all documents in the collection share the same access requirements.\n\n**Access Modeling:**\n\n*   The application employs a path-based ownership model. Any authenticated user (even anonymously) can create error reports.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):**\n\n*   The flat structure of `/artifacts/{appId}/public/data/error_reports/{errorReportId}` allows listing all error reports securely. Security rules can easily ensure that only authenticated users can create reports.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n*   The path includes `appId` to facilitate multi-tenancy or project separation if needed in the future."
